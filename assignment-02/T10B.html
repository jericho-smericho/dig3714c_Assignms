        As someone who read a lot, I have leagues of the best most well-written,
        soulful, gutwrenching prose that is ever to be dreamt of. And then I've
        read some of worst trash, bottom of the barrel, abominable books that
        has no place on any but the Devil's bookshelf. Having such experience
        gives me ample right to recommend books that almost anyoen should read!

        <p>
          <i
            >Tayo, a young Native American, has been a prisoner of the Japanese
            during World War II, and the horrors of captivity have almost eroded
            his will to survive. His return to the Laguna Pueblo reservation
            only increases his feeling of estrangement and alienation. While
            other returning soldiers find easy refuge in alcohol and senseless
            violence, Tayo searches for another kind of comfort and resolution.
            Tayo's quest leads him back to the Indian past and its traditions,
            to beliefs about witchcraft and evil, and to the ancient stories of
            his people. The search itself becomes a ritual, a curative ceremony
            that defeats the most virulent of afflictions—despair.</i

          This book is at the Top of my list for the best books of all time
          Marmon-Silkp is a master of mixing poetry and prose, weaving despair
          and earnest hope into the histories she writes. The characters are
          fully realized, their past driving them to achieve what they believe
          they want, and their hearts bringing them to achieve what they truly
          need. After reading this I was out of commition for a week straight.
          The writing blunt at times but never unkind in what it was saying.
          Definitely worth the read. Worth a thousand reads, in my personal
          opinion.

        <p>
          <i>
            Raina just wants to be a normal sixth grader. But one night after
            Girl Scouts she trips and falls, severely injuring her two front
            teeth, and what follows is a long and frustrating journey with
            on-again, off-again braces, surgery, embarrassing headgear, and even
            a retainer with fake teeth attached. And on top of all that, there’s
            still more to deal with: a major earthquake, boy confusion, and
            friends who turn out to be not so friendly. This coming-of-age true
            story is sure to resonate with anyone who has ever been in middle
            school, and especially those who have ever had a bit of their own
            dental drama. <u>more...</u>

          I read this book at a time in my life when I was just beginning to
          grow into I wasn't quite sure I liked. This book really helped with
          that. Telgemeier perfectly captures how finding yourself, your
          friends, and morals can be hard as a kid. This was an incredible book
          to read in middle school, and while we're all a lot older than that
          now, maybe your inner child needs a bit of healing. Not only a great
          read, but a quick one.

        <p>
          <i>
            Chicago, 1954. When his father Montrose goes missing, twenty-two
            year old Army veteran Atticus Turner embarks on a road trip to New
            England to find him, accompanied by his Uncle George—publisher of
            The Safe Negro Travel Guide—and his childhood friend Letitia. On
            their journey to the manor of Mr. Braithwhite—heir to the estate
            that owned Atticus’s great grandmother—they encounter both mundane
            terrors of white America and malevolent spirits that seem straight
            out of the weird tales George devours. At the manor, Atticus
            discovers his father in chains, held prisoner by a secret cabal
            named the Order of the Ancient Dawn—led by Samuel Braithwhite and
            his son Caleb—which has gathered to orchestrate a ritual that
            shockingly centers on Atticus. And his one hope of salvation may be
            the seed of his—and the whole Turner clan’s—destruction.

          If you like H.P. Lovecraft, there's a great chance that you're going
          to enjoy this book. The is nothing like the cheap jumpscares that
          movies resort to these days. This is deep, instictual horror that
          builds and builds through each chapter until you're bursting with
          anticipation and dread. Here's the problem though: This book has an
          entirely black cast that exists in Jim Crow era America, which factors
          heavily into the horror of the book. To fully and correctly capture
          that experience, it's best to have first experienced it yourself (or
          have some cultural tie to it) but the author of the book does not.
          It's weird, because the book is phenomenal, but there's a handful of
          parts that rub me the wrong way due to the treatment or actions of
          some of the characters. The way that these specific characters are
          presented or treated come off as a shallow understanding of what that
          experience is or is just completely off the mark of whatever message
          is trying to be said. Overall the book is great but it's still good to
          mention it.

            Lyra is rushing to the cold, far North, where witch clans and
            armored bears rule. North, where the Gobblers take the children they
            steal--including her friend Roger. North, where her fearsome uncle
            Asriel is trying to build a bridge to a parallel world. Can one
            small girl make a difference in such great and terrible endeavors?
            This is Lyra: a savage, a schemer, a liar, and as fierce and true a
            champion as Roger or Asriel could want--but what Lyra doesn't know
            is that to help one of them will be to betray the other.

          Okay, so I'm kind of cheating with this one since it's a series rather
          than a single book. But I don't think y'all would understand just how
          incredible the book is without reading the entire thing. Pullman
          masterfully meshes realistic fantasy with biblical theology to craft
          this triology, all the while arguing for intrinsic human goodness,
          freedom from state-mandated guilt, and and a love for the life we have
          now over an afterlife we hope to gain. My personal belief (that has
          yet to fail mme) is that an book banned by catholi church for heresy
          and blasphemy is a book worth reading, and these books? Definitely
          worth the read.

            First, the unthinkable: a security breach at a secret U.S.
            government facility unleashes the monstrous product of a chilling
            military experiment. Then, the unspeakable: a night of chaos and
            carnage gives way to sunrise on a nation, and ultimately a world,
            forever altered. All that remains for the stunned survivors is the
            long fight ahead and a future ruled by fear—of darkness, of death,
            of a fate far worse. <u>more...</u>

          This book is not what it seems. Read that summary? it really just
          seems like some cheesy scifi novel you'd find in the airport convience
          store. But this book holds so. much. more. This book spans a hundred
          years, detailing the fall of civilization and it's rise after it, all
          while following a little girl who was there from the beginning. It's
          damn near poetry with how Cronin has written it. The one critiism I
          can give is that while it follows the one constant character of the
          book, the audience rarely gets to see her perspective or her own
          agency develope past that of the people around. Which I can see being
          hard to write since she starts off as like, six or eight years old in
          book, but it kind of seems like an issue that Cronin created for
          himself and should be fixed by him. While the book fails in that
          aspect, it hits the mark in every other category. Run don't walk to
          the bookstore to get this book.

        <h5><i>Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer</i></h5>
        <p>
          <i>
            In April, 1992, a young man from a good family hitchhiked to Alaska
            and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name
            was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings
            to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned
            all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself.
            Months later, a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body.
            How McCandless came to die is unforgettable. McCandless had roamed
            through the West and Southwest on a quest like those made by his
            heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned
            his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his
            cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and,
            unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in
            the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Leaving
            behind his desperate family, he vanished into the wild.

          I'll be completely honest, when I first read this book, I hated it. It
          was a required reading for class and I hated anything approaching
          realistic fiction or biographical works. But after reading it a time
          or two, I grew to respect it. Christopher McCandless is an interesting
          and complex subject, and the journalistic approach to detailing his
          life and demise provides additional intrigue to his life. People argue
          about his reasons, what he was thinking, if he was a saint or just
          another arrogant asshole that thinks off-the-grid living is something
          anyone can do. But there's no real answers to the whys, and moralizing
          his life in anyway doesn't get us anywhere. The one truth is that he
          is a person, not some character that teaches us all a great lesson.
          And the book sticks to that theme till the end. Definitely an
          interesting read.

          Oh, boy, is this a bad book. There had to be one on this list and it's
          gotta be this one. This book is the edgiest, not-like-the-other-girls,
          YA book to ever exist. Actually, I this book predates when YA started
          to really get popular. The plot makes no sense, every time you think
          it's over, it just keeps going, every action has to overdramatic in
          the best way, and it was cringe even for 2005. So why am I telling you
          to read this trash??? It's because the most fun you'll have on a
          Saturday afternoon. There are at least 12 books in this series and
          every single one an insane ride from start to finish. You literally
          cannot tell where any plot is going and it is amazing. It has all the
          vibes of Twilight or Divergent but with worse plots, more zany
          characters, more love triangles, and 10x the fun. I promise you, you
          will not regret reading this series, it's so bad it's good.

          interesting way, perfectly capturing how a twelve year old boy would
          handle his pain through the guise of fantasy. The blurring of
          imagination and reality is a useful metaphor of the relationships the
          main character has with the people around him. It's heartbreaking, but

          This is such a heist book. It's like <i>Ocean's 11</i> got eaten by
          <i>Knives out</i>
          and thrown threw the window J.R.R. Tolkein to send the message that
          this is how fantasy is done. The characters are endearing and despite
          how morally gray they are, you still root for them to achieve all
          their goals, even when they conflict with your OTHER favorite
          character's goals. Not a single person here is entirely good, and it
          hoenstly makes the story so much better for it. The world building is
          incredible and you get the feel that there's so much more history
          behind everything that's being said. This book is a spinoff of the
          Shadow and Bone series, but you really don't have to read it in order

          Okay, now hear me out- <i>WAIT, HEAR ME OUT</i>- I know, okay?
          Fangirls? Shipping? obvious Supernatural-based show with an insane fan
          community? GAYS??? I get it. It's cringe. but remember, 1. this is my
          list, 2. cringe is dead, get over it, 3. I warned y'all that I'd be
          self-indulgent. This book exams the fandom behaviors in the early to
          mid-2010s in a funny and scarily realistic way, following the main
          character Claire, who is terminally online and a big part of the
          <i>Demon Heart</i>
          community on Tumblr. When I was younger, I was in similar fan spaces,
          and this book really spoke to me about some of the toxic behaviors
          that went on in the groupthink that was fandom during that time. But
          the book goes farther than that and speaks to how lighthearted and fun
          fandom can be. Friends, community, even love somehow were found in
          these fan spaces for people who often felt ousted from the people
          around them. And while it has it's drawbacks, it's not a bad thing.
          This book has an honest and positive view of fandom and how it affects
          both the fans and the actors.
