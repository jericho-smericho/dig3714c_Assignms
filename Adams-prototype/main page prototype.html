            <h2><strong>History of Origami!</strong></h2>
            <p>The history of origami and it's origins are rather muddled, considering much of the information on the art form before the 15th century is virtually non-existent. From what is known, origami has it's origins in Japan and China. So what is it? Origami is essentially the folding of a sinle sheet of square paper into a representation of an animal or object. Traditional Japanese origami is a lot more abstract in the shapes and animals it has. Modern origami has become far more complex, so complex that some physists have taken to studying orgami and it's applications to real life. <a href ="#History">   Learn More...</a></p>

                <h2>About Us!</h2>
                    <p>My earliest memory of making Origami was when I was a child, visiting the library. A librarian taught me how to make an origami crane, and from there, I was in love. Learning origami teaches many skills, and is also pretty fun! making cute animals, beautiful cards ,and other things brings a new kind of joy into life! That is what we are trying to achieve.</p>
