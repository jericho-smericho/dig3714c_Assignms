    <p>The history of origami and it's origins are rather muddled, considering much of the information on the art form before the 15th century is virtually non-existent. From what is known, origami has it's origins in China when paper was first created. So what is it? Origami is essentially the folding of a sinle sheet of square paper into a representation of an animal or object. Traditional Japanese origami is a lot more abstract in the shapes and animals it has. Modern origami has become far more complex, so complex that some physists have taken to studying orgami and it's applications to real life.</p>

    <p>When origami finally made it to Japan, it was mainly used for ceremonial use and decorations for gifts. Different clans would use origami in religious ceremony to adorn ceremonial tools. When giving gifts, it was popular to add an origami flower or butterfly to wrapping paper. At a certain point in time it was even custom to wrap money with some forom of origami on the outside. Weddings, funerals, and over such occassions, all had some kind of origami attached to it.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until the 16th and 17th century that origami in Japan became a leisurely activity. This is when more animals and toys were bein made with origami. A popular game was Menko! Players would fold an overlappign square, similar to an envelope and attempt to flip other players menko by throwing their square at it as harad as possible. Oriagmi began gaining popularity overseas in the late 19th century and early 20th century when origami began being taught in art classes, both for kindergarteners and high end art schools.</p>
