        College is an insane transition arc for any student that decides to take
        it on. Moving away from home, being around new people, it's a total
        culture-shock! And a university like UCF? <i>Sheesh</i>, that's even
        worse, what with a huge campus and hundreds of organizations, majors,
        clubs, greek clubs, etc. For me, though, my "journey" doesn't begin in
        UCF, it actually begins in a little college down in Boca Raton, an hour
        away from Miami, right on the Atlantic. How did I end up there? Why did
        I leave? How in the world have I survived UCF as a transfer student at
        the DOWNTOWN CAMPUS DORMS of all places? Here's my roundabout process of
        getting to UCF!

          In August of 2021, I moved into the dorms of FAU as a film major.
          Pretty different from what I'm doing now, huh? I hadn't done much
          research on the college and I really didn't know what I wanted to do
          with my life, so I chose the first thing that seemed mildly
          interesting to me: film.
        </p>

        <p>
          The college was more geared towards business and biology majors, so
          all the arts and creative majors would stick together.

          />
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Being there felt like a deadend. It was hard to meet people, I kept
          getting worse and worse roommates, and class sizes for film got so
          small that I couldn't get into any of my required classes. I was
          miserable there and I really didn't know what to do.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          All of that, combined with drama, and losing my few friends, prompted
          me to leave there as soon as possible. I didn't have the motivation to
          stay there, so why force myself to? I decided on a different major
          that more aligned with my goals, chose a better school, and started
          getting everything I needed to get out of there! It was a hard
          decision to make because it felt like I was wasting the time and
          energy of everyone who helped me get to college. But I had to get past
          the sunk-cost fallacy my mind had crerated in order to actually move
          on with my life.

          The application process was easy enough, waiting for an acceptance
          letter? That was the hard part. Sure, I got into college once alright,
          but doing so a second time time doesn't stop the anxiousness. I
          prayed, read tarot, and begged any higher power that I got into this
          school.

          For how often I was checking my email, I got the acceptance letter the
          day I was at a concert. And from there it was a mad dash to get the
          transcripts, paperwork, and documentation in so that I can get on to
          class registration. It was kind of a whorlwind after that, but I had
          finally made it.

        <h3>Step 3: Make the Most of It!</h3>
        <p>
          Coming to UCF was actually kind of scary, I transferred in not knowing
          anyone, not living on main campus, and just feeling out of my depth in
          the huge school. But I kept with it, kept trying to meet new people,
          do better in my schoowork, and just get new experiences. And It
          worked! Compared to my last college, I was doing better grade wise,
          mental health wise, and even socially! This year was nothing like how
          I thought it would be and honestly? I'm happy for it! Taking that leap
          of face was terrifying, and at times I even regretted it. But in the
          end, making it to UCF was the best decision I could've made.
