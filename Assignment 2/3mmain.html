                <p><i>Ceremony by Leslie Marmon-Silko</i></p>
            </div> 
                <p class="grid-item sum01"><i>Tayo, a young Native American, 
                    has been a prisoner of the Japanese during World War II, 
                    and the horrors of captivity have almost eroded his will 
                    to survive. His return to the Laguna Pueblo reservation 
                    only increases his feeling of estrangement and alienation. 
                    While other returning soldiers find easy refuge in alcohol 
                    and senseless violence, Tayo searches for another kind of 
                    comfort and resolution. Tayo's quest leads him back to the 
                    Indian past and its traditions, to beliefs about witchcraft 
                    and evil, and to the ancient stories of his people. The search 
                    itself becomes a ritual, a curative ceremony that defeats the 
                    most virulent of afflictions — despair.</i></p>

                <p class="grid-item ana01">This book is at the Top
                    of my list for the best books of all time. Marmon-Silko
                    is a master of mixing poetry and prose, weaving despair 
                    and earnest hope into the histories she writes. The 
                    characters are fully realized, their past driving
                    them to achieve what they believe they want, and their 
                    hearts bringing them to what they truly need. You really 
                    need to sit with this one in order to appreciate it.

                    from prison, Shadow's wife, Laura, dies in a 
                    mysterious car crash. Numbly, he makes his way back 
                    home. On the plane, he encounters the enigmatic 
                    Mr. Wednesday, who claims to be a refugee from a distant 
                    war, a former god and the king of America.
                    Together they embark on a profoundly strange journey across 
                    the heart of the USA, whilst all around them a storm of 
                    preternatural and epic proportions threatens to break.</i></p>

                <p class="grid-item ana02">The American mythos, written

                    brokendown pickup to every monument and side attraction
                    there is in this country. Honestly, I'm surprised there's
                    not more Neil Gaiman on this list because the way he writes
                    is phenomenal. At what point does culture clash with progress?
                    Can they co-exist, or are we doomed to lose our collective
                    identities as the price for assimilation?

                <p><i>A Tale, Dark, and Grimm by Adam Giddwitz</i></p>
            </div> 
            <p class="grid-item sum03"><i>In this mischievous and utterly 
                original debut, Hansel and Gretel walk out of their own story 
                and into eight other classic Grimm-inspired tales. As readers 
                follow the siblings through a forest brimming with menacing foes, 
                they learn the true story behind (and beyond) the bread crumbs, 
                edible houses, and outwitted witches.
                Fairy tales have never been more irreverent or subversive as Hansel 
                and Gretel learn to take charge of their destinies and become the clever 
                architects of their own happily ever after.</i></p>   

            <p class="grid-item ana03">Okay, so I know that I said
                that this list would have a diverse amount of genres,
                and thus far it's only been fantasy. But I warned you 
                that I'd be self-indulgent, so this is more on you. The 
                narrator is delightfully witty, putting twist after twist
                on common and uncommon Grimms fairtails, and weaving them
                all into one big, gruesome, and horror filled tale. Yes, 
                this is a children's book. And yeah, it freaked me out for a 
                month after reading. Best. Month. Of my life.

                <p><i>Smile by Raina Telgemeier</i></p>
            </div>
            <p class="grid-item sum04"><i>Raina just wants to be a normal sixth grader. 
                But one night after Girl Scouts she trips and falls, severely injuring 
                her two front teeth, and what follows is a long and frustrating journey 
                with on-again, off-again braces, surgery, embarrassing headgear, and even 
                a retainer with fake teeth attached. And on top of all that, there’s still 
                more to deal with: a major earthquake, boy confusion, and friends who turn 
                out to be not so friendly. This coming-of-age true story is sure to resonate 
                with anyone who has ever been in middle school, and especially those who have 
                ever had a bit of their own dental drama.</i></p>    

            <p class="grid-item ana04">I read this book at that weird point in 
                my life when I was just beginning to grow into a person and I wasn't 
                quite sure I liked them. This book really helped me fix that. This was
                more of a nostalgia recommendation, and you would probably get more out 
                of it if you were in middle school, but this doesn't stop it from being 
                a genuinely good read. It's funny, heartfelt, and doesn't pull it's punches
                even when you really want it to.

                <p><i>Love Craft Country by Matt Ruff</i></p>
            </div>    
            <p class="grid-item sum05"><i>The critically acclaimed cult novelist makes 
                visceral the terrors of life in Jim Crow America and its lingering effects 
                in this brilliant and wondrous work of the imagination that melds historical 
                fiction, pulp noir, and Lovecraftian horror and fantasy.
                Chicago, 1954. When his father Montrose goes missing, twenty-two year old Army 
                veteran Atticus Turner embarks on a road trip to New England to find him, 
                accompanied by his Uncle George — publisher of The Safe Negro Travel Guide — and 
                his childhood friend Letitia. On their journey to the manor of Mr. Braithwhite — 
                heir to the estate that owned Atticus’s great grandmother—they encounter both 
                mundane terrors of white America and malevolent spirits that seem straight out 
                of the weird tales George devours.</i></p>

            <p class="grid-item ana05">If you like H.P. Lovecraft, there's a great chance you're
                going to enjoy this book. The horror isn't like the cheap scary movies they pump out 
                with boring jumpscares at every turn. This is deep, instinctual horror that builds and 
                builds through each chapter until you're bursting with anticipation and fear. Here's the 
                problem though. This book as an entirely black cast that exists in Jim Crow era America.
                And that factors heavily in the horror of the book. To fully capture that experience it's 
                best to have first experienced it yourself, but the author of the book - from what I've
                searched on him - has not. It's weird, because the book is phenomenal, but there's a handful of 
                parts of the book that rub me the wrong way due to either the treatment or actions of some of the 
                characters. Could some of it be feasible? Sure, there's even historical precedent of it happening.
                But the way these events or arcs are used and presented are simply off in some kind of way. 
                The book is definitely still great, but it's definitely something that makes you think.

                    Lauren Olamina and her family live in one of the only safe neighborhoods remaining on the

                and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. 
                He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the 
                cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found 
                his decomposed body. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.</i></p> 

            <p class="grid-item ana07">Honestly, I didn't like this book at first. Actually, I didn't like the man he was about
                He was full of contradictions, unearned self-assuredness, unexplainable motives. But after rereading it, I realized 
                what I wasn't getting: I forgot that this was a real person. This is a journalistic investigation into the life and 
                death of a guy who lived a life that was worth living to him. Not all of his actions will be understandable, and he 
                might not seem to be the charming protagonists one usually reads about, but he's a person, and this book captures that 
                well.</p>

                sunrise on a nation, and ultimately a world, forever altered. All that remains for the stunned survivors is the long fight

                has triggered apocalypse. Wolgast is determined to protect her from the horror set loose by her captors, but for Amy, escaping 
                the bloody fallout is only the beginning of a much longer odyssey—spanning miles and decades—toward the time and place where

            <p class="grid-item ana08">This book sent me for a serious loop. At first you're thinking, "wow! a surrogate father to this poor little

                but think "damn, this shit is actually insane, let me get that next book..." The book is so well written, the backstories, worldbuilding,
                and most importantly the MYSTERY of it all! The book is tragic, the characters are so endearing and losing them to either death or just time 
                hurts, but isn't that part of the journey? Despite all that this book is so, so, SO worth the read.

                is a very good reason why this book was banned by the Catholic Church for being heretical, and it's not for the cover art. The entire thesis of 
                the work is beautiful and hopeful; it speaks to inherent goodness of humankind, to the bonds that share and how that makes us better people. The 
                book isn't without criticism and of course there are things to be improved, but even with the flaws the message is far from diluted.

                    dreams of bigger roles. When the two meet at a local Comic-Con panel, it's a dream come true for Claire. Until the Q&A, that is, when Forest 
                    laughs off Claire's assertion that his character is gay.Claire is devastated. After all, every last word of her super-popular fanfic revolves 
                    around the romance between Forest's character and his male frenemy. She can't believe her hero turned out to be a closed-minded jerk. Forest 
                    is mostly confused that anyone would think his character is gay. Because he's not. Definitely not. Unfortunately for Demon Heart, when the video 
                    of the disastrous Q&A goes viral, the producers have a PR nightmare on their hands. In order to help bolster their image within the LGBTQ+ community-as 
                    well as with their fans-they hire Claire to join the cast for the rest of their publicity tour. What ensues is a series of colorful Comic-Con clashes 
                    between the fans and the show that lead Forest to question his assumptions about sexuality and help Claire come out of her shell. But how far will Claire 
                    go to make her ship canon? To what lengths will Forest go to stop her and protect his career? And will Claire ever get the guts to make a move on Tess, 
                    the very cute, extremely cool fanartist she keeps running into? Ship It is a funny, tender, and honest look at all the feels that come with being a fan.
